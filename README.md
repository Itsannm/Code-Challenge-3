# Movie Ticket Booking

This is a simple web app that allows users to book movie tickets online. Users can browse through a list of movies, view their details, and buy tickets if they are available.

## Features

- The app uses HTML/CSS/JS only frontend that accesses data from a public API.
- All interactions between the client and the API are handled asynchronously and use JSON as the communication format.
- The entire app runs on a single page with no redirects.
- The app incorporates at least 3 separate event listeners (DOMContentLoaded, click, change, submit, etc).
- Some interactivity is required such as adding a "like" button or adding comments. These interactions do not need to persist after reloading the page.
- The code follows good coding practices by keeping it DRY (Do not repeat yourself) by utilising functions to abstract repetitive code.
